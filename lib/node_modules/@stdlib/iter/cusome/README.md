<section class="intro">

This module provides an iterator function `iterCuSome` that creates an iterator to iteratively test whether at least `n` truthy values have been encountered from a source iterator. It continues iterating as long as there are values available from the source iterator.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var iterCuSome = require( '@stdlib/iter/cusome' );
```

#### iterCuSome( array2iterator, n )

Returns an iterator which cumulatively tests whether at least `n` iterated values are truthy.

```javascript
var array2iterator = require( '@stdlib/array/to-iterator' );

var arr = array2iterator( [ false, false, false, true, true ] );

iterator = iterCuSome( arr, 2 );

v = iterator.next().value;
// returns false

v = iterator.next().value;
// returns false

// ..
```

<section class="notes">
    
## Notes
    
- The iterCuSome function returns an iterator which continues to iterate over values from the source iterator until at least n truthy values are encountered.
- If fewer than n truthy values are encountered, it returns false. Once n truthy values are encountered, it returns true and stops further iteration.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var randu = require( '@stdlib/random/iter/randu' );
var iterMap = require( '@stdlib/iter/map' );
var iterCuSome = require( '@stdlib/iter/cusome' );

function threshold( r ) {
    return ( r > 0.95 );
}

// Create an iterator which generates uniformly distributed pseudorandom numbers:
var opts = {
    'iter': 100
};
var riter = randu( opts );

// Create an iterator which applies a threshold to generated numbers:
var miter = iterMap( riter, threshold );

// Create an iterator which cumulatively tests whether at least 5 iterated values are truthy:
var it = iterCuSome( miter, 5 );

// Perform manual iteration...
var r;
while ( true ) {
    r = it.next();
    if ( r.done ) {
        break;
    }
    console.log( r.value );
}
```
